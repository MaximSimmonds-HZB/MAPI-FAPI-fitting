28.01.2024 LPtrPL FAPI.

BP 710 10 excitation, LP715 emission. 

Heat up PMT for around an hour. Before that, we use the APD for the power dependencies. 

Sample FAPI 6927 Spot 1:. Align the lasdr focus and APD. 
	1) We measure the power dependence. PMT is turned on for the start of the measurements.  

	2) PMT, measure power dependence. 1h20 (until 1630)
	On for 4 hours without gain. Left 10 minutes, gain at 0.73mV

	3) PMT, Measure LPtrPL with 10,100,700us, 1kHz for 120 (x3) minutes. Power is 20uW for 10us 1kHz. (180 minutes until 1930)

	4) PMT, measure power dependence. (+All nighter: Measure trPL for hours, see if it relaxes or not). 


Sample FAPI 6927 Spot 2:
	5) PMT, measure power dependence. 1h20 

	6) PMT, Measure LPtrPL with 700us, 1kHz for 120 (x3) minutes. Power is 2uW for 10us 1kHz.

	7) PMT, measure power dependence. +All nighter: Measure trPL for hours, see if it relaxes or not.

Sample FAPI 6927 Spot 3:
	
	8) PMT, measure power dependence. 1h20 

	9) PMT, Measure LPtrPL with 700us, 1kHz for 120 (x3) minutes. Power is 2uW for 10us 1kHz.

	10) PMT, measure power dependence. +All nighter: Measure trPL for hours, see if it relaxes or not.
